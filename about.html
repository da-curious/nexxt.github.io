               <h2>DC5561, a.k.a. DEFCON Group Brasilia is an authorized Brazilian local group of the official DEFCON, "the world's longest running and largest underground hacking conference". Our goal is to share high-quality security knowledge with our local comunity.</h2>
               <h3>As stated in the DEFCON Groups FAQ: "The DEFCON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other computer groups, but rather to provide yet another gathering place for the discussion of technology and security topics."</h3>
               <h3>We have spoken at some local conferences, and we appreciate all the support and collaboration from other initiatives such as Owasp and BSides.</h3>
